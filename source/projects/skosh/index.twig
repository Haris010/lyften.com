    <h2>Why Skosh?</h2>
    <p>PHP static site generator. Fast and easy to get started. If your language of choice is PHP, you'll feel right at home if you need to extend Skosh.</p>

    <p>Embedded Composer. Forget about managing library versions manually! Skosh embeds Composer to keep your source control focused and projects consistent.</p>

    <p>Twig templates. Twig is a full-featured modern template engine. It's simple to learn and it is extendable, documented, concise and flexible.</p>

    <p>Symfony's HTTP Kernel. Skosh is built on it. This lets you use Symfony Bundles to extend Skosh for any advanced functionality you need without extending Skosh directly.</p>
