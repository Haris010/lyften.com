## Installation

In order to get started, you'll want to install Gulp globally. You may need to use sudo (for OSX, *nix, BSD etc) or run your command shell as Administrator (for Windows) to do this.

```bash
$ npm install --global gulp
```

This will put the Gulp command in your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.


## TODO

This needs to be flesh out a lot more.
