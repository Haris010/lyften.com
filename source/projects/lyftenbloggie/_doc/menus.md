### How to set a page as default?
1. While you are still in the Menu Item Manager, let's set your "LyftenBloggie Front Page" as default.
2. For this purpose check its radio button and click on [**Default**] from the top menu.
3. Optionally, you can remove the default link "Home" because we will not need it.

### Setting up your Author's Menus
All author menus can be setup in this manner.

1. From the admin panel, go to **Menus** > **User Menu**
2. Let's add links to LyftenBloggie Manage Entries. For this purpose click on [**New**] from the top-left menu and select the item type. In our case it will be **Internal link** - **LyftenBloggie** - **Manage Entries**.
3. Fill in the information about the links. Let's call the link "Manage Entries". It is recommended that the menu item's "Access Level" be set to **Registered** or higher.
4. Save the link by clicking on [**Save**] from the top-right menu.
