LyftenBloggie comes with many built-in plugins. Here is a list of them:

Please not that any newly added plugin by default is disabled and must be enabled before they can accessible to the system.

### Installing Plugins
Installing plugins couldn't be any easier. You have two choices:

* Download them by visiting **Lyften.com**
* From LyftenBloggie's admin section **Settings** > **Install Addons**. Where they are remotely downloaded and installed.

To install manually downloaded Component Plugins such as the [CKEditor Plugin](http://archived.lyften.com/products/2-lyftenbloggie/extensions/component%20plugin/27-ck-editor-plugin.html), they will need to be installed from **Settings** > **Plugins** and not from Joomla's **Extensions** > **Install/Uninstall**.
